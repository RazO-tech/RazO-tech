### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on React JS
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript frameworks
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Any library

```javascript
let skills = ["JavaScript","React JS","HTML5","CSS3","jQuery","SASS/SCSS"]

const Razmik = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Web Developer</h1>
      {skills.map(
        skill => {
          <h2>{skill}</h2>
        }
      )}
    </div>
  )
}  

```
